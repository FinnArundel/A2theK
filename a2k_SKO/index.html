    <p>The A to the K Computational Typography studio is an introduction into the world of typography and code. The combination of these design fields aims to give the designer the ability to engage with their audience through immersive and interactive experiences with type through the browser and other mediums.<br><br> The studio highlights approaches to modern typography such as variable typography and the innovation it brings to design, particular for interactive experiences. A type design agency like ABC Dinamo creates typefaces that are able to dynamically change weight and other variables to adjust for any context. <br><br> A personal approach I took to this studio was exploring the relationship between the computer and designers. During the course of the semester I became interested in how the computer is able to take over as well as assist in creative work through approaches such as programmable design systems and the use of Artificial Intelligence. <br><br>The studio consisted of both in person and online learning, often exploring coding in our Tuesday classes and typography on Thursday. Throughout the semester we would share case studies to help with our research, learn different coding techniques, as well as learn typographical fundamentals. The studio was a collaborative space which encouraged sharing of ideas and progress of our final assignments.
